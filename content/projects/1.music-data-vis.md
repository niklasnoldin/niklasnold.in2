description: Visualizing the beat and lyrics of "Versager" by Lugatti & 9ine
---

Translating sound into visuals has been the focus of my work recently and this project is part of it. With a data-driven approach an image is generated for each bar (every 4 beats) in the song “Versager” by the Cologne-based hiphop duo [Lugatti & 9ine](https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/artist/4eZg2h2Qez5XuD6PQAqGie).

The basis of the case-study was the song file only from which a spreadsheet was created with the numbers of each of the “instruments” in the song.

From there the spreadsheet was imported into [Cavalry](https://cavalry.scenegroup.co/), an animation software focused on a generative approach to motion design, in which the graphics were created.

Every visual element corresponds to one of the following sounds and is layered over each other to create a visual for each bar in the song:

- Kick drum
- Bass
- Guitar
- Claps
- Hi-Hats
- Distorted bass
- Syllables main lyrics
- Syllables adlibs

The chosen sounds are the main building blocks of this specific song and the visual language is chosen to fit with the style of the artist.
