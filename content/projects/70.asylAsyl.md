"asyl asyl", meaning "Asylum! Asylum!" in German, is a collection of poems by Peter Giacomuzzi. The Italian born, Austrian living misfit author sees himself as a kind of asylum seeker without a clear heritage and puts these parallels in the focus of the funny and critical poems and word plays.

The book plays with this very serious topic in a respectful but cheerful manner and criticises the global politics in great satirical manner.

The German version of the book was published by [edition baes](https://www.edition-baes.com/) and is available [on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/asyl-Peter-Giacomuzzi/dp/3950418660/).
