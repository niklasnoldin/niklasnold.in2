A place to celebrate birthdays, organize concerts and raves, as well as exhibition spaces and offices for the youth of my hometown Innsbruck.

The translated "young valley station" is a youth and cultural center built into the abandoned valley station of the old Hungerburg Bahn which connected the city of Innsbruck with it's higher lying burrow Hungerburg for nearly 100 years.

When tasked with the creation of a brand for the house as well as the club who is managing the venue I already knew that it needed to be something as versatile and ever-evolving as the house itself as well as being easy to use by non-designers. Therefore, I created an extensive library of custom icons describing many of the concepts and objects the house represented. From these icons the logo system was formed by combining any four of the icons together with the word mark in a very youthful script font (remember that the target audience here are 16 year olds).

From this the main logos were created for the major concepts of the venue, for example parties, literature and theater.

The branding included mostly digital assets as well as a facade stickers but got extended to several event posters afterwards.
