A place to be for the youth of my hometown Innsbruck. Where theater and literature meets drunk 16 year olds.

The translated "young valley station" is a youth and cultural center built into the abandoned valley station of the old Hungerburg Bahn which connected the city of Innsbruck with it's higher lying burrow Hungerburg for nearly 100 years.
