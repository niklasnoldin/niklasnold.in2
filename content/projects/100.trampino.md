Donald Trump is a very <em title="stupid">controversial</em> person. That's also what the author Peter Giacomuzzi thought and proceeded to write "61 fake poems in fake language" about the president.

It's available [on Amazon](https://smile.amazon.de/trampino-fake-poems-language-English-ebook/dp/B077QVWKGL/) as paperback and Kindle.
