Do you know Shazam? It's like Shazam but worse.

With musicr \[mjuzikar\] you are able to find out what that super groovy song is called that you are currently shaking off to in your favourite club (it's probably [Uptown Funk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)). It listens to the music and shows you all the information you need, including lyrics, to really step up your game in the club.

It uses the fingerprinting and database functions provided by ACR Cloud and is able to recognise more than 72 million songs. This is the same technology which is used by international companies like Huawei, Musixmatch, and Deezer.

The whole website was coded together with Georg Schreglmann during a one week programming frenzy carried out as part of the bachelor program at the University of Applied Science Salzburg.
